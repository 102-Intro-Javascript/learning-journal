# Learning the differences between the text editors

## Basic Editors

These basic editors come pre-installed on your operating system. They allow you to enter code and create websites but lack any bells and whistles that other software of IDE may offe. These editors use plain text and do not allow you to use bold, italic, font size or any other form of editing the text. You will also save these files locally on your machine and its important to ensure you keep them all within the same directory and proper file extensions such as .html and .css. 

## Advanced Editors

These advanced editors provide a few more bells and whistles and require you to have internet access to download and install. They allow you to code faster and more efficiently by helping you complete brackets, syntax, quotations. They also reduce eye strain by darkening of the screen while making the text brighter colors which will allow you to code longer without fatigue. One of the best benefits of these is seperating different type of coding into different colors that will allow you to spot and correct errors much faster.

## IDE

IDE is like the suites of text editing software. 
>An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.

That is the major benefet of an IDE vs just coding software is it lets you do everything that you need to do all bundled into one saving you time and providing you and your company more efficiency.

## So which do i choose?

Well this boils down to your personal preference, your companies preferrence and the needs of the task. Some editors provide better extensions than others or work better in some situations than others. Ultimately you will perform better in software you're more used to using vs new software that you need to learn how to move around.
