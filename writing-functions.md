# Writing Functions

## Basics
* you can call create functions in order to call them at different parts of your page, this will allow you to keep a single file for all of your javascript scripts
* you must know the differences between strings, integers, boolenas etc
* You must be able to know the difference between () [] {} : and ;
* You must remember to treat the code like you are teaching the computer how to do what its being told step by step. Remember it isn't a human and if not told to do something or told what something is it won't know unless you tell it.
