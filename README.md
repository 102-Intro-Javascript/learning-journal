## About Me

I am a Marine veteran with 5 deployments under his belt who served as the Aviations Operations Chief at my last command. I have been out since 2012 and searching for a career. I have been interested into IT since I was a kid. I was building computers since I was 12, building websites and networks and troubling IT issues around 15-16. So I looks forward to pursuing a career into coding.
