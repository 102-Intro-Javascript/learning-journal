# Introduction to Git and GitHub

## Functionality

GitHub is an only storage of files for the purpose of working on a project as a team. Git allows you to store the repo locally
to your machine for editing and then publishing those changes to the GitHub website. Git doesn't make changes to the code but is
the the mechanism in which you pull the latest version of that file you are working on to your machine, or push to publish the 
changes you have made to the cloud. In other words it syncs everything together while detecting conflicts between your local version
and the version in the cloud. It also helps detect when their are conflicts on the same line of code being modified by different
developers on the team.

GitHub provides you the ability to create branches of the project so different developers or different teams of developers can work
on particular parts of the project. Someone might work on functionality another fixing bugs and while another is improving the Ui 
experience. The branching allows each developer and team to work on the project at the same time while not stepping on eachothers toes.
This also provides a record of changes of made in case of something goes wrong and testing can be done before merging it into a single file.

GitHub + Git provide a great process for developers to work together as well as a safety net in case a platform goes down or loss of internet.
This way they can continue to work on the code and not have to worry about local files being corrupted or losing the entire project altogether.
